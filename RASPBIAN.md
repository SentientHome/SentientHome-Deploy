# Configuration

As described in the Raspberry PI README we are combing the Model 2 or 3 B with
a Samsung SSD 250/500GB or larger. Here is a simple step by step guide on how
to configure the setup from scratch.

## Initial SD Card Setup

We recommend to start with a clean image of the latest version of
[RASPBIAN](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). While you can get
preloaded SD Cards with Raspberry NOOBS on it, they are usually already outdated
by them time you get them and more importantly include a lot of software and
extras that just get in the way of storage and a clean install.

[raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org) has some great
[Installation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md)
procedures for the various Operation Systems out there.

### OS X El Capitan

Here a quick summary for the latest version of OS X 10.11.x

1.  We recommend starting with downloading the latest
[RASPBIAN LITE](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest)

2.  Next insert a new SD Card e.g.
[SanDisk Ultra 32GB UHS-I/Class 10 Micro](http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-SDSDQUAN-032G-G4A-Memory-Adapter/dp/B00M55C0NS)
with a suitable USB adapter into one of your Macs USB ports.

3.  Open a Terminal window.

4.  Now make sure you are in your users home directory: `cd⏎`

5.  From there head to your Donwloads folder: `cd Downloads⏎`

6.  Find the recently downloaded Raspian image: `ls *raspbian*lite.zip⏎`

    e.g. `2016-03-18-raspbian-jessie-lite.zip`

    Note: The filename contains the date of the release and will therefor change
    frequently. Make sure you use the most recent version.

7.  Unzip the package: `unzip 2016-03-18-raspbian-jessie-lite.zip⏎`

8.  Validate that the image file has been created: `ls *raspbian*lite.img⏎`

    e.g. `2016-03-18-raspbian-jessie-lite.img`

    Note: Like before the filename contains the date of the release.

9.  Now we look up the BSD name of the SD Card we want to apply the image to:
    `diskutil list⏎`

    Look for and entry like `/dev/disk? (external, physical):` where `?` and
    number like `2` or `3` ... In many cases the disk will be named
    `dev/disk2` or `dev/disk3`unless your system has multiple internal or
    external storage devices.

    In order to make sure you are looking at the correct disk entry make sure
    the entry is marked `external` and the SIZE matches the the capacity of the
    SD card. IN our case the 32GB SD Card shows up as `31.9 GB`

    Note: In some cases specific SD cards only work with some USB SD card
    adapters. If your SD card does not show up, it is possible that the SD card
    USB adapter is not working with this specific type of SD card.

10. Next we unmount the disk. In our case the BSD disk name is `dev/disk2`
    This is how we unmount the device: `diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2⏎`

    Look for confirmation: `Unmount of all volumes on disk2 was successful`

11. Now we copy the image to the SD card:
    `sudo dd bs=1m if=2016-03-18-raspbian-jessie-lite.img of=/dev/disk2⏎`

    Note: As mentioned before replace the img name with the version you have
    downloaded and the BSD disk name with the one from your system.
    Also this process can take some time - as in several minutes. To get
    realtime updates on progress hit `<control>+T`

Now you should have a working image to perform a clean, initial boot-up of your
Raspberry PI 2/3. Make sure your PI is connected to the network/internet via
patch cable, as it will require an active internet connection for the remainder
of the initial setup.

## Finalizing the Boot Image Setup

Now that we have a working boot SD card for our brand new Raspberry PI, the
next steps will be performed on the Raspberry itself.

For that, install the device in the case of your choosing, install the brand
new boot SD card, connect keyboard, mouse (optional) and a monitor.

Once wired up, connect the Raspberry to power and watch it boot up. You should
see the red LED light up permanently and the green LED flashing randomly,
whenever the device performs IO operations - as in reads or writes from the
SD card.

1.  Initial bootup will only take a few seconds and you will find yourself at
    the login prompt: `raspberrypi login:`

    The default credentials of the Raspberry PI are: username: `pi` and
    password `raspberry`. Enter those credentials and you should be
    successfully logged into your brand new Raspberry PI.

2.  This next step you should consider mandatory, must have, no time to
    procrastinate:

    __Now is the time to change the password! Don't put this off
    until later. Later means you are running around with a big security hole
    target on your forehead. IoT and Home Automation are already known for
    their weak information security standards. Don't contribute with yet
    another easy to hack system in the world.__

    in order to change the default user password simply type in:
    `passwd⏎` followed by the current password `raspberry` and then two
    iterations of the new password. Consider something decently strong. Most
    password generators give you various options. Multiple words separated by
    a simple sign are a very good start and usually easy to remember. Choose
    something like 3 or 4 words minimum: `align_corrode_brim` but make it your
    own, hard to guess combination.
    A password generator and wallet are definitely the pro choice.

3.  Now that the system is no longer open to the world, lets setup the basics
    with the built in config tool: `sudo raspi-config⏎`

4.  Once we are in the config screen we expand the boot volume to its maximum
    size. A PI that runs out of storage starts doing very weird and bad things:
    Choose `1 Expand Filesystem⏎` changes to the size will become active at
    the very next reboot.

5.  While there are lots of options to choose from, we recommend you keep it
    simple, predictable and hopefully reliable. For example Overclocking should
    be a __BIG NO-NO__. We dont need a fraction more performance, we need
    reliability for this little computer to run 24x7x365.

    The only thing we really want to get done before we reboot is to make sure
    we have the latest version of the update tool by selecting:
    `9 Advanced Options⏎` followed by `A0 Update⏎`

6.  The final step for the reboot inside the config utility is to make sure our
    SSH server is enabled. From here on out we want the ability to SSH into
    the PI without the need for local keyboard, mouse or monitor.

    To do so simply select `9 Advanced Options⏎` followed by `A4 SSH⏎` then
    select `Enable⏎` and `Ok⏎` and close out the config utility via `Finish⏎`.

7.  Back at the command prompt its now a good idea to perform a full reboot.
    Simply enter `sudo reboot⏎` and watch the PI run through a quick restart
    sequence.

8.  Once rebooted, log back into the PI with username `pi` and your new __secret
    password__. Alternatively all steps from here on out can be performed via
    SSH from a remote computer, e.g. a Mac terminal session.

9.  Now we are updating all the key packages as well as the firmware by running
    the following commands:

    ``` shell
    sudo su
    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade
    apt-get install rpi-update
    rpi-update
    reboot
    ```

    These will update all core components of our setup to the very latest
    available versions. And reboot the computer to apply the changes made.

We now have a basic working and initialized setup that we can leverage for one
or multiple Raspberry PIs.

## Backing up the Raspberry PI

With the necessary tools in place we can start doing our first backup of the
newly configured Raspberry PI:

``` shell
mkdir -p /home/pi/backups
sudo tar --exclude=/home/pi/backups --one-file-system -cvzf "/home/pi/backups/`uname -n`.`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`.backup.tar.gz" / /boot
ls -la /home/pi/backups
```

Make a note of the backup file name as we will need it for cloning/restoring
on to the new SD Card in the next step:

``` shell
total 370448
drwxr-xr-x 2 pi   pi        4096 Mar 27 19:13 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 pi   pi        4096 Mar 27 17:51 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 379325527 Mar 27 18:20 raspberrypi.20160327181510.backup.tar.gz
```

Note: Since we are making a complete backup of the boot SD onto itself, we need
ample storage in order to not fill up the device with as little as a single
backup archive. This is why we recommend a 32GB boot SD card. This is also the
reason why we chose the Raspbian LITE distribution. A full backup should be
approximately 380MB - before installing additional software or any Sentient
Home data.

## Cloning the SD Card

Now that we have a full backup of the clean install we can create an SD Card
clone by simply restoring the backup onto a newly partitioned and formatted
card. We recommend you continue to use 32GB cards, that way you always have
ample storage including multiple backups.

1.  Insert a brand new 32GB Micro SD card into a USB adpater and into one of the
    USB ports of the Raspberry.

2.  Now we need to identify the device name that we need to partion, format and
    restore the backup to. Simply enter `sudo fdisk -l⏎`.

    The bottom of the output should look similar to this:

    ``` shell
    Device         Boot  Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
    /dev/mmcblk0p1        8192   131071   122880   60M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
    /dev/mmcblk0p2      131072 62333951 62202880 29.7G 83 Linux

    Disk /dev/sda: 29.7 GiB, 31914983424 bytes, 62333952 sectors
    Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    Disklabel type: dos
    Disk identifier: 0x00000000

    Device     Boot Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
    /dev/sda1        8192 62333951 62325760 29.7G  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
    ```

    Note: Ignore all the RAM disks but if you have additional storage devices
    attached pay extra attention to pick the right disk name. The name you pick
    will get repartitioned, formatted and overwritten. As such any data on that
    device will be lost.

    In this case the name of our external SD Card is `/dev/sda` and matches
    approximately the 32GB of capacity. (Storage vendors always multiply and
    round in decimals rather than binary)

    To verify one more time that we have selected the correct name simply run
    `sudo parted --script /dev/sda "print"⏎`

    The output should look similar to this:

    ``` shell
    Model: Mass Storage Device (scsi)
    Disk /dev/sda: 31.9GB
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
    Partition Table: msdos
    Disk Flags:

    Number  Start   End     Size    Type     File system  Flags
     1      4194kB  31.9GB  31.9GB  primary  ext4         lba
    ```

    Note: The bottom list represents existing partitions on the device.
    Depending on brand and prior usage this can be a single or multiple ones.

3.  With the name of the SD Card `/dev/sda` disk in hand we can now partition
    the card so it can be used as a boot card.

    ``` shell
    sudo parted --script /dev/sda  "mklabel msdos"
    sudo parted --script /dev/sda  "mkpart primary fat16 1MiB 64MB"
    sudo parted --script /dev/sda  "mkpart primary ext4 64MB -1s"
    sudo mkfs.vfat  "/dev/sda1"
    sudo mkfs.ext4 -F -j "/dev/sda2"
    ```

    Note: We are creating 2 partitions: A 64MB msdos fat and the remainder of
    the card as a Linux ext4 and formatting them in their respective file
    systems.

    To verify the new card layout run `sudo parted --script /dev/sda  print⏎`

    The output should look similar to this:

    ``` shell
    Model: Mass Storage Device (scsi)
    Disk /dev/sda: 31.9GB
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
    Partition Table: msdos
    Disk Flags:

    Number  Start   End     Size    Type     File system  Flags
     1      1049kB  64.0MB  62.9MB  primary               lba
     2      64.0MB  31.9GB  31.9GB  primary
    ```

4.  With the card newly partitioned and formatted its time to mount the file
    systems and copy/restore our backup onto the card.

    ``` shell
    sudo mkdir -p /tmp/pi.sd.restore
    sudo mount "/dev/sda2" "/tmp/pi.sd.restore"
    sudo mkdir -p /tmp/pi.sd.restore/boot
    sudo mount "/dev/sda1" "/tmp/pi.sd.restore/boot"
    sudo tar -xvzf  "/home/pi/backups/raspberrypi.20160327181510.backup.tar.gz" -C "/tmp/pi.sd.restore"
    ```

5.  With this the restore/clone is complete. At this point modifications can be
    made but should not be required, as we will leverage Ansible scripts to
    inventory, update, configure the Raspberry PI (or many) from a single
    central location.

    We can now unmount the new SD card from the system by typing

    ``` shell
    sudo umount /tmp/pi.sd.restore/boot
    sudo umount /tmp/pi.sd.restore
    ```

    With that the card can be safely removed from the
    Raspberry PI, either for retention/safekeeping or to boot up new instances
    of additional Raspberry PIs. By using these clones you can quickly bring up
    and entire army of PIs if you so desire.

## Operating from HDD or SSD

Now onto some more permanent and scalable as well as reliable storage options.
A 32GB SD Card provides ample of storage for the basics, but beyond that we will
require 'real' storage. A bit part of that is also reliability.
SD Cards don't like to be written to a lot and will fail fairly quickly if too
much data gets continuously written to them.

This is where an HDD or better an SDD comes into the play. As mentioned in the
recommended configuration README for the Raspberry PI, we opt to use a Samsung
T1 or the newer T3 external SSDs. They are fast - in fact way faster that the
PI can currently utilize, they are reliable and extremely low on power
consumption. They don't require an external USB hub and as such we can leverage
the 10W PoE power supplies to power both the Raspberry PI 2/3 as well as the
SSD.

Note: We commonly see 3-5W of power draw from the complete config including an
external SD Card (for ongoing backups) and the mentioned 500GB SSD.

You cannot run a Raspberry PI only on an HDD or SDD and you always require the
boot loader SD Card from witch the Raspberry needs to start its boot sequence.
However we can 'catch' the boot process and continue it from the SSD.

This is how to setup the Raspberry to run off an HDD/SDD. The setup is very
similar to the process of creating and cloning a boot SD card.

1.  Attache the SDD or HDD to one of the USB ports of the Raspberry. We
    recommend to leave the Micro SD USB adapter in its exiting slot for ongoing
    backups and in case you need to clone more SD card. This will also ensure
    that the SDD or HDD gets a new deveice name different from the '/dev/sda'
    the SD card occupies.

2.  Now we need to identify the device name that we need to partion, format and
    restore the backup to. Like before simply enter `sudo fdisk -l⏎`.

    The bottom of the output should look similar to this:

    ``` shell
    Disklabel type: dos
    Disk identifier: 0x6f92008e

    Device         Boot  Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
    /dev/mmcblk0p1        8192   131071   122880   60M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
    /dev/mmcblk0p2      131072 62333951 62202880 29.7G 83 Linux

    Disk /dev/sda: 29.7 GiB, 31914983424 bytes, 62333952 sectors
    Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    Disklabel type: dos
    Disk identifier: 0x60b85697

    Device     Boot  Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
    /dev/sda1         2048   124927   122880   60M  e W95 FAT16 (LBA)
    /dev/sda2       124928 62333951 62209024 29.7G 83 Linux

    Disk /dev/sdb: 232.9 GiB, 250059350016 bytes, 488397168 sectors
    Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    Disklabel type: dos
    Disk identifier: 0x01a46122

    Device     Boot Start       End   Sectors   Size Id Type
    /dev/sdb1  *       64 488392128 488392065 232.9G  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT
    ```

    In this case the name of our external SSD is `/dev/sdb` and matches
    approximately the 500GB of capacity. (Storage vendors always multiply and
    round in decimals rather than binary)

    To verify one more time that we have selected the correct name simply run
    `sudo parted --script /dev/sdb "print"⏎`

    The output should look similar to this:

    ``` shell
    Model: Samsung Portable SSD T3 (scsi)
    Disk /dev/sdb: 250GB
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
    Partition Table: msdos
    Disk Flags:

    Number  Start   End    Size   Type     File system  Flags
     1      32.8kB  250GB  250GB  primary               boot
    ```

    Note: The bottom list represents existing partitions on the device.
    Depending on brand and prior usage this can be a single or multiple ones.

3.  With the name of the SSD `/dev/sdb` disk in hand we can now partition
    the disk so it can be used as a our system drive.

    ``` shell
    sudo parted --script /dev/sdb  "mklabel msdos"
    sudo parted --script /dev/sdb  "mkpart primary fat16 1MiB 64MB"
    sudo parted --script /dev/sdb  "mkpart primary linux-swap(v1) 64MB 4G"
    sudo parted --script /dev/sdb  "mkpart primary ext4 4G -1s"
    sudo mkfs.vfat  "/dev/sdb1"
    sudo mkswap /dev/sdb2
    sudo mkfs.ext4 -F -j "/dev/sdb3"
    ```

    Note: We are creating 3 partitions: A 64MB msdos fat partion, a 4GB swap and
    the remainder of the disk as a Linux ext4 and formatting them in their
    respective file formats.

    To verify the new SSD layout run `sudo parted --script /dev/sdb  print⏎`

    The output should look similar to this:

    ``` shell
    Model: Samsung Portable SSD T3 (scsi)
    Disk /dev/sdb: 250GB
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
    Partition Table: msdos
    Disk Flags:

    Number  Start   End     Size    Type     File system     Flags
     1      1049kB  64.0MB  62.9MB  primary  fat16           lba
     2      64.0MB  4000MB  3936MB  primary  linux-swap(v1)
     3      4000MB  250GB   246GB   primary  ext4
    ```

4.  With the SSD newly partitioned and formatted its time to mount the file
    systems and copy/restore our backup onto the card.

    ``` shell
    sudo mkdir -p /tmp/pi.ssd
    sudo mount "/dev/sdb3" "/tmp/pi.ssd"
    sudo mkdir -p /tmp/pi.ssd/boot
    sudo mount "/dev/sdb1" "/tmp/pi.ssd/boot"
    sudo tar -xvzf  "/home/pi/backups/raspberrypi.20160327181510.backup.tar.gz" -C "/tmp/pi.ssd"
    ```

5.  Now that the SSD or HDD has a copy of our current system, we need to modify
    some of the boot settings to start using the SSD as soon as the boot has
    progressed far enough beyond the point were it needs the SD Card as a boot
    medium.
    Change the mount configuration file on the new root:

    ``` shell
    sudo vi /tmp/pi.ssd/etc/fstab
    ```

    and replace '/dev/mmcblk0p2' with '/dev/sdb3' and add /dev/sdb2 as a swap
    partition by adding this line: '/dev/sdb2 none swap sw 0 0'

    Now remove the old swapfiles that will no longer get used because of
    the dedicated swap partition.

    ``` shell
    sudo rm /tmp/pi.ssd/etc/rc?.d/*dphys-swapfile
    sudo rm /tmp/pi.ssd/var/swap
    sudo cp /boot/cmdline.txt /boot/cmdline.orig
    ```

    Finally point the boot loader to the new file system on the SSD:

    ``` shell
    sudo vi /boot/cmdline.txt
    ```

    and replace '/dev/mmcblk0p2' with '/dev/sdb3' and `reboot⏎`
